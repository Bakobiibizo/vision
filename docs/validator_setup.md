# Valiadator modes
Validators have 2 choices for running the validation - and you can swap between them at any time!

Validators should see very similar vtrust regardless of the mode you run.

## Synthetic only validator
This is the simpler of the the two. This is the more classical setup, where a validator queries and tests miners using synthetic data which reflects real world data.

No external facing server is needed, and you do not expose any servers to the outside world. You won't be able to sell your bandwidth to real world users, which is the downside.

To setup a validator of this kind, you'll need to create the config for it.
